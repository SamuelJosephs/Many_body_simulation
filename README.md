# Many_body_simulation
Simulation of many gravitationally attracted bodies using SDL2.

To build you must have SDL2 installed and the .so or .dll files setup such that the compiler of your choice can link them.
The make file will work with both gcc and clang, just change the cc variable in the makefile to whichever one you want to use.
